# Epoch Registrations

This is a Slack bot built with Typescript and Slack Bolt. It is designed to be a simple way for community members in Slack to quickly register for our upcoming event: Epoch 2022.

**The Event’s Vision:** An epic, global high schooler-led hackathon organised in public to inspire the community and bring hundreds of Hack Clubbers together in Asia in the winter - the most epic hackathon this winter

**Budget:** $40K for event itself. $4K emergency budget for day-of. There will be more costs around sending HQ staff and making a film, etc., this will come from HQ & not be in the event’s budget.

**Staffing:** High schooler led, with HQ staff support and involved.
